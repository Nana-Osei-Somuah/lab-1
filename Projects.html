        <h1 style="text-align: center;color:#66fcf1">My Projects</h1>
        <p>
            I have completed four projects so far in Ashesi.
        </p>
        
        <h2 style="text-align: center;color:#66fcf1">Data Structures and Algorithms Project</h2>
        <p>
            For our Data Structures project I, along with my partner, created an inventory management
            <br>system for a shop using the hashtable data structure and the list data structure.
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;color:#66fcf1">Database Project </h2>
        <p>
            For my database project I created a database system for the teams in the Pacific division
            <br>of the NBA for a mini tournament. This system stores the information of the players, teams
            and the games played during the tournament.
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;color:#66fcf1">Programming for CS Project </h2>
        <p>
            For my Programming for CS project I created a snake game. <br>Unlike the usual snake game I
            included a timer to increase the difficulty of the game.
